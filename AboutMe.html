    <h1>Zaid Bin Naveed</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Born, raised and lived entire life in Karachi</h2>
    <p>My name is Zaid Bin Naveed, and I was born on 25th February 2004 in the bustling city of Karachi, Pakistan, a
        place that has always been both my home and my foundation. Growing up in this vibrant city taught me about
        diversity, resilience, and the importance of family bonds. Being the youngest in my family, I was fortunate to
        receive an abundance of care, love, and guidance from those around me. This position in the family often made me
        the one who learned from the experiences of my elders, while also being encouraged to carve out my own path.
        Those early years instilled in me the value of hard work, discipline, and the belief that challenges, no matter
        how big or small, can be overcome with determination.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My educational journey took root in the Beaconhouse School System, one of the leading institutions in Pakistan,
        where I studied up to the AS level. Those years were a defining time for me, as I discovered not only my
        strengths in academics but also my ability to push myself beyond limits. With consistent effort, focus, and
        countless hours of preparation, I was able to secure 8 A/As* in my examinations, which earned me a prestigious
        Gold Medal in academic achievement. That award was more than just a medal; it was a recognition of my hard work,
        a reward for the sacrifices I made, and a moment of pride for my family who always stood by my side. To this
        day, it remains one of the milestones that motivate me to aim higher in everything I do.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Personal Struggles</h2>
    <p>However, life is never a straight path. In 2020, I faced one of the most painful chapters of my life when my
        grandfather, my tower of support and a guiding light, passed away due to COVID-19. His loss was devastating,
        leaving an emptiness that words cannot describe. My grandfather had always been someone I looked up to, someone
        who believed in me unconditionally, and his encouragement had been my strength through so many challenges.
        Losing him left me emotionally broken, and I fell into a period of depression where even the simplest things
        felt overwhelming. Yet, even in his absence, I held on to his teachings—his resilience, his calm in the face of
        hardship, and his belief that no matter how hard life becomes, one must always rise again. Slowly, I found my
        footing, pushed through the grief, and began to rebuild myself with a stronger resolve.</p>
    <h2>Coding Journey Starts</h2>
    <p>In 2023, I took a bold step forward by enrolling at FAST NUCES, Karachi, one of the top universities for computer
        science and engineering. It was a completely new chapter, filled with challenges that tested my patience and
        abilities. Coding, in particular, was not something that came naturally to me at first. I struggled to keep up,
        made countless mistakes, and often felt like I was falling behind others who seemed more skilled. But I reminded
        myself of the journey I had already walked—the achievements, the losses, and the comebacks. I knew that giving
        up was never an option. Slowly but steadily, I began improving, gaining confidence with each new project, and
        embracing coding not just as a subject, but as a skill that would define my future.
        <br>
        My coding journey officially began in 2023, and it is only the beginning of something much bigger. Each day, as
        I learn and practice, I see growth—not only in my technical skills but also in my mindset. Coding has taught me
        patience, problem-solving, and the ability to think differently, qualities that I know will help me far beyond
        academics. I see it as more than just a career path; it is a way of building solutions, expressing creativity,
        and contributing to a world where technology continues to transform lives.
    </p>
    <h2>I'm not done</h2>
    <p>This is my story so far, and while it is filled with both triumphs and struggles, I know it is only the opening
        chapter of a much larger journey. I believe the future holds endless opportunities, and I am determined to seize
        them with everything I have. To everyone reading this, I invite you to stay with me as I continue to learn,
        grow, and create more projects that reflect not only my skills but also the resilience and passion that define
        who I am.</p>
