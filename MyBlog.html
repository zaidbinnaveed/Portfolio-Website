    <h1>The Many Sides of Me: Tech, Fights, and Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Most people use the internet to look up quick answers, but for me, it's a place to sharpen my mind, challenge my
        passions, and spark debates that range from coding intricacies to the greatest fighters in MMA history. Scroll
        through my journey, and you'll see a life built on curiosity, resilience, and a love for both knowledge and
        competition.</p>
    <h2>The Scholar of Code</h2>
    <p>I don't just study programming—I live inside it. From wrestling with object-oriented programming concepts like
        this pointers and template classes, to handling linked lists in C++ and diving into assembly language with
        Irvine32, I treat each coding challenge like a puzzle waiting to be solved.

        My projects reflect that passion. Writing a 1600-line Airport Management System in C was one of my biggest
        achievements, and I take pride in keeping my code simple yet elegant—no fluff, just logic. I don't aim to scrape
        by; I aim to master the craft.</p>
    <h2>The MMA Philosopher</h2>
    <p>When it comes to combat sports, I've got strong opinions. For me, the GOAT of MMA is Fedor Emelianenko over Jon
        Jones. Greatness isn't just about records—it's about who you fought, when you fought them, and whether you
        dodged challenges.

        I respect fighters like Georges St-Pierre, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Anderson Silva, but I question Jon Jones'
        legacy. Looking at the future, I see Islam Makhachev as the closest active fighter to breaking into the GOAT
        conversation—especially if he beats Ilia Topuria, who I think is his most dangerous threat.</p>
    <h2>Music and Culture</h2>
    <p>My taste in rap is rooted in respect for lyricism and influence. My Top 5 Rappers are Rakim, Tupac, Biggie,
        Eminem, and Lil Wayne—artists who didn't just shape hip-hop, but entire generations.</p>
    <h2>Curiosity Without Borders</h2>
    <p>I've always been the type to ask questions that go beyond the surface. One day I'll be digging into how the
        Pakistan Meteorological Department collects weather data, the next I'll be exploring things like:

        How did Pakistan manage to build a nuclear bomb but still struggles with AESA radar?

        Is Saudi Arabia really building a $10 billion refinery in Pakistan?

        Does the White House really have a secret underground train for the President?

        For me, knowledge isn't just about answers—it's about pushing into the unknown.</p>
    <h2>The Anime Debater</h2>
    <p>When I'm not coding or analyzing MMA legacies, I'm deep in anime debates. Whether it's Gojo vs. Sukuna, Tanjiro
        vs. Kokushibo, or imagining prime Roger, Whitebeard, and Garp showing up in the Egghead arc, I love breaking
        down abilities, strategies, and “what if” battles.

        I approach anime the same way I approach MMA—seriously, with analysis and passion.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion: The Mind of a Modern Polymath</h2>
    <p>I'm not just a coder, a fight fan, or an anime enthusiast—I'm someone who thrives across multiple lanes. From
        Bayesian networks to Islamic views on comas, from debating GOATs in MMA to ranking the greatest rappers, I chase
        knowledge and curiosity wherever it leads me.

        My story is still being written, but if the past is any sign, the next chapters will be even more fascinating.
